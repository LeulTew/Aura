# Client Project Plan: "Aura Pro"

**Vision**: A Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform for Photo Studios  
**Target Release**: 2026  
**Stack**: Next.js 15, FastAPI, Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector), WebUSB

---

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

### System Architecture

![System Architecture](docs/diagrams/system_architecture.png)

The Aura Pro platform follows a multi-tenant architecture where all users authenticate through a unified login on the landing page. Based on their role stored in the `profiles` table, users are redirected to their respective portals:

- **SuperAdmin Portal** (`/superadmin`): Platform operators (us) manage all tenants, monitor usage metrics, set billing limits, and control system health.
- **Studio Admin** (`/admin`): Tenant administrators manage their studio's photos, employees, sources, and bundles. All queries are scoped to their `org_id`.
- **Photographer Station** (`/capture`): Employees upload photos, create bundles, and view assigned events. Limited permissions (no delete/settings access).

The Supabase backend enforces strict data isolation through Row Level Security (RLS) policies. Each table contains an `org_id` column, and queries automatically filter based on the authenticated user's organization.

### User Roles & Permissions

| Role | Portal | Capabilities |
|------|--------|--------------|
| **SuperAdmin** | `/superadmin` | Full platform access: Manage tenants, view all usage metrics, set billing limits, system health monitoring, audit logs |
| **Admin** | `/admin` | Studio management: Employees, sources, photos, bundles, settings. Can invite employees and manage storage |
| **Employee** | `/capture` | Upload photos, create bundles, view assigned events. Cannot delete photos or access settings |
| **Guest** | `/scan` | Face-scan to find their photos in a specific event. No account required, session-based |

### Storage Architecture (Ethiopia-Optimized)

![Storage Architecture](docs/diagrams/storage_architecture.png)

Designed for Ethiopian market conditions where internet connectivity can be unreliable and expensive, the hybrid storage architecture supports multiple workflows:

1. **Event Photography (Mobile)**: Photographers at events upload directly to "Event Temp Storage" using mobile data. Photos are marked as temporary and can be reviewed/archived later at the studio.

2. **Studio Workflow (Local Primary)**: Studios register local folders (e.g., `D:\Photos\2026`) as sources. The Sync Agent monitors these folders and performs:
   - **Offline Queue**: Actions queued in IndexedDB when offline
   - **Delta Sync**: Only changed files synced, reducing bandwidth
   - **Bandwidth Limit**: Configurable upload speed to avoid saturating connection
   - **Local Search**: Vector index maintained locally for offline face search

3. **Hybrid Search**: API can search both cloud and local sources, with results merged and deduplicated.

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Core Multi-Tenant Tables
organizations (id, name, slug, plan, storage_limit_gb, storage_used_bytes, is_active, created_at)
profiles      (id → auth.users, email, display_name, role, org_id → organizations, created_at)
photos        (id, path, full_path, embedding, org_id, source_type, photo_date, metadata, created_at)
bundles       (id, name, photo_ids[], org_id, created_by, created_at)
usage_logs    (id, org_id, user_id, action, bytes_processed, metadata, created_at)

-- Key Constraints
• profiles.role IN ('superadmin', 'admin', 'employee')
• photos.source_type IN ('cloud', 'local_sync', 'event_temp')
• organizations.plan IN ('free', 'pro', 'enterprise')
```

### RLS Policy Summary

| Table | SuperAdmin | Admin | Employee |
|-------|------------|-------|----------|
| organizations | ALL | SELECT own | SELECT own |
| profiles | ALL | SELECT org | SELECT org |
| photos | ALL | ALL org | SELECT/INSERT org |
| bundles | ALL | ALL org | SELECT/INSERT org |
| usage_logs | ALL | SELECT org | - |

### Authentication Flow

1. User visits `/` (Landing Page)
2. Enters credentials (PIN for MVP, email/password planned)
3. Backend validates credentials and fetches profile from `profiles` table
4. JWT token generated with claims: `{role, org_id, org_slug, exp}`
5. Response includes `redirect` path based on role
6. Frontend stores token in sessionStorage and navigates to appropriate portal

## 📅 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Upgrade (Backend) [DONE]

**Goal**: Migrate from ephemeral local CSV/LanceDB to cloud-native Supabase.

- [x] **Setup Supabase**: Initialize project, enable `pgvector` extension for vector similarity search
- [x] **Schema Design**: Create tables for `users`, `photos`, `bundles`, `embeddings` with proper indexes
- [x] **Migrate Logic**: Rewrite `database.py` to use Supabase client instead of local LanceDB
- [x] **Authentication API**: Implement `POST /auth/face-login` for face-based authentication

> **Tech Details**: Using `pgvector` with HNSW index for sub-100ms similarity search on 100k+ embeddings.

### Phase 2: Core UX & "No Cable" Sync [FRONTEND] [DONE]

**Goal**: Build the Admin Capture Station with direct camera connection.

- [x] **WebUSB Integration**: Implement `tethr` library for PTP protocol camera communication
- [x] **Sync Pipeline**: Camera → Browser (Blob) → Supabase Storage with progress tracking
- [x] **Dexie Cache**: Local IndexedDB caching for instant thumbnail preview

> **Tech Details**: WebUSB requires HTTPS. Camera detection via `navigator.usb.requestDevice()`.

### Phase 3: Public Face [FRONTEND] [DONE]

**Goal**: Professional landing page and seamless guest experience.

- [x] **Landing Page**: "Void 2.0" design with hero section, admin login, and marketing content
- [x] **Gallery 2.0**: Virtualized grid using TanStack Virtual for 10,000+ photos
- [x] **QR Generation**: Admin can generate unique event QR codes for guests

> **Design**: Glassmorphism, spatial depth, animated backgrounds using CSS transforms.

### Phase 4: Intelligence & Delivery [CORE] [DONE]

**Goal**: Advanced face search and efficient download management.

- [x] **Backend Search**: `match_faces` RPC function using cosine similarity with configurable threshold
- [x] **Download Manager**: Client-side zip generation using `jszip` to reduce server load

> **Performance**: HNSW index enables ~50ms search across 100k embeddings.

### Phase 5: Multi-Tenant Platform [IN PROGRESS]

**Goal**: Role-based access control and SuperAdmin management portal.

#### 5A: Database Foundation [DONE]
- [x] **Organizations Table**: Tenants with plan limits and storage tracking
- [x] **Profiles Table**: Users with roles (superadmin/admin/employee)
- [x] **RLS Policies**: Strict tenant isolation via `org_id` filtering
- [x] **Role-Based JWT**: Login returns token with role, org_id, org_slug claims
- [x] **SuperAdmin Portal**: `/superadmin` route with tenant CRUD and stats dashboard

#### 5B: SuperAdmin Portal Enhancements [TODO]
- [ ] **Usage Dashboard**: API calls per tenant, searches/day, chart visualizations
- [ ] **Billing Management**: Upgrade plans, set custom limits, overage alerts
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Track all superadmin actions with timestamps
- [ ] **Tenant Onboarding**: Email workflow for new tenant invites

#### 5C: Tenant Admin Scoping [TODO]
- [ ] **Scoped Queries**: All `/admin` queries filtered by `org_id` from JWT
- [ ] **Employee Management**: Invite via email, assign roles, remove access
- [ ] **Usage Tracking**: Middleware to log API calls and storage usage

### Phase 6: Hybrid Storage [PLANNED]

**Goal**: Local + Cloud sources optimized for Ethiopian market conditions.

#### 6A: Cloud Enhancements [TODO]
- [ ] **Source Types**: Add `source_type` column (cloud/local_sync/event_temp)
- [ ] **Sources UI**: Admin can register and manage storage sources
- [ ] **Event Temp Tier**: Auto-cleanup after 30 days, convert to permanent on approval

#### 6B: Sync Agent (Desktop App) [TODO]
- [ ] **Desktop App**: Electron/Tauri application for Windows/Mac
- [ ] **Folder Watch**: Monitor registered local directories for changes
- [ ] **Offline Queue**: IndexedDB-based queue for actions during offline periods
- [ ] **Delta Sync**: Only sync file changes, not full files
- [ ] **Bandwidth Throttle**: Configurable upload speed limit (KB/s)
- [ ] **Local Vector Index**: Face embeddings stored locally for offline search
- [ ] **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with manual override option
