---

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

### System Architecture

![System Architecture (SVG)](docs/diagrams/system_architecture.svg)
![System Architecture (PNG)](docs/diagrams/system_architecture.png)

The Aura Pro platform follows a multi-tenant architecture where all users authenticate through a unified login on the landing page. Based on their role stored in the `profiles` table, users are redirected to their respective portals:

- **SuperAdmin Portal** (`/superadmin`): Platform operators (us) manage all tenants, monitor usage metrics, set billing limits, and control system health.
- **Studio Admin** (`/admin`): Tenant administrators manage their studio's photos, employees, sources, and bundles. All queries are scoped to their `org_id`.
- **Photographer Station** (`/capture`): Employees upload photos, create bundles, and view assigned events. Limited permissions (no delete/settings access).
- **Guest Scan** (`/scan`): Event attendees find their photos via face recognition. No account required.

### User Roles & Permissions

| Role           | Portal        | Capabilities                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SuperAdmin** | `/superadmin` | Full platform access: Manage tenants, view all usage metrics, set billing limits, system health monitoring, audit logs |
| **Admin**      | `/admin`      | Studio management: Employees, sources, photos, bundles, settings. Can invite employees and manage storage              |
| **Employee**   | `/capture`    | Upload photos, create bundles, view assigned events. Cannot delete photos or access settings                           |
| **Guest**      | `/scan`       | Face-scan to find their photos in a specific event. No account required, session-based                                 |

### Storage Architecture (Ethiopia-Optimized)

![Storage Architecture (SVG)](docs/diagrams/storage_architecture.svg)
![Storage Architecture (PNG)](docs/diagrams/storage_architecture.png)

Designed for Ethiopian market conditions where internet connectivity can be unreliable and expensive, the hybrid storage architecture supports multiple workflows:

1. **Event Photography (Mobile)**: Photographers at events upload directly to "Event Temp Storage" using mobile data. Photos are marked as temporary and can be reviewed/archived later at the studio.

2. **Studio Workflow (Local Primary)**: Studios register local folders (e.g., `D:\Photos\2026`) as sources. The Sync Agent monitors these folders and performs:

   - **Offline Queue**: Actions queued in IndexedDB when offline
   - **Delta Sync**: Only changed files synced, reducing bandwidth
   - **Bandwidth Limit**: Configurable upload speed to avoid saturating connection
   - **Local Search**: Vector index maintained locally for offline face search

3. **Hybrid Search**: API can search both cloud and local sources, with results merged and deduplicated.

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Core Multi-Tenant Tables
organizations (id, name, slug, plan, storage_limit_gb, storage_used_bytes, is_active, created_at)
profiles      (id → auth.users, email, display_name, role, org_id → organizations, created_at)
photos        (id, path, full_path, embedding, org_id, source_type, photo_date, metadata, created_at)
bundles       (id, name, photo_ids[], org_id, created_by, created_at)
usage_logs    (id, org_id, user_id, action, bytes_processed, metadata, created_at)

-- Key Constraints
• profiles.role IN ('superadmin', 'admin', 'employee')
• photos.source_type IN ('cloud', 'local_sync', 'event_temp')
• organizations.plan IN ('free', 'pro', 'enterprise')
```

### RLS Policy Summary

| Table         | SuperAdmin | Admin      | Employee          |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| organizations | ALL        | SELECT own | SELECT own        |
| profiles      | ALL        | SELECT org | SELECT org        |
| photos        | ALL        | ALL org    | SELECT/INSERT org |
| bundles       | ALL        | ALL org    | SELECT/INSERT org |
| usage_logs    | ALL        | SELECT org | -                 |

### Authentication Flow

1. User visits `/` (Landing Page)
2. Enters credentials (PIN for MVP, email/password planned)
3. Backend validates credentials and fetches profile from `profiles` table
4. JWT token generated with claims: `{role, org_id, org_slug, exp}`
5. Response includes `redirect` path based on role
6. Frontend stores token in sessionStorage and navigates to appropriate portal

## 🔐 Phase 5.5: User & Access Management Workflows [NEW]

> **Goal**: Define detailed end-to-end workflows for platform governance, user management, and access control.

### SuperAdmin Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    SuperAdmin->>Aura: Login at /login
    Aura-->>SuperAdmin: Redirect to /superadmin

    Note over SuperAdmin: Tenant Provisioning
    SuperAdmin->>Aura: Create New Organization
    Aura->>DB: INSERT organizations
    SuperAdmin->>Aura: Create Primary Admin for Org
    Aura->>DB: INSERT profiles (role=admin, org_id)
    Aura->>Email: Send invite to admin@tenant.com

    Note over SuperAdmin: Tenant Management
    SuperAdmin->>Aura: View Usage Dashboard
    Aura-->>SuperAdmin: Storage, API calls, searches per tenant
    SuperAdmin->>Aura: Edit Tenant (Plan/Storage Limit)
    SuperAdmin->>Aura: Suspend/Activate Tenant
```

**SuperAdmin Capabilities**:
| Action | Endpoint | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Create Organization | `/superadmin` → Create Tenant | Sets slug, initial plan, storage limit |
| Create Primary Admin | `/superadmin` → Add Admin | Links to organization, triggers invite |
| Edit Tenant Config | `/superadmin` → Edit Modal | Plan upgrade, storage limit change |
| Suspend/Activate | `/superadmin` → Toggle | Revokes/grants all org access |
| View Platform Stats | `/superadmin` Dashboard | Total tenants, photos, storage |
| View Activity Feed | `/superadmin` Sidebar | Real-time usage logs |

### Tenant Admin Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    TenantAdmin->>Aura: Accept Invite Email
    TenantAdmin->>Aura: Set Password
    TenantAdmin->>Aura: Login at /login
    Aura-->>TenantAdmin: Redirect to /admin

    Note over TenantAdmin: Employee Management
    TenantAdmin->>Aura: Invite Employee
    Aura->>DB: INSERT profiles (role=employee, org_id)
    Aura->>Email: Send credentials/setup link

    Note over TenantAdmin: Photo Management
    TenantAdmin->>Aura: Upload Photos (Drag/Drop)
    TenantAdmin->>Aura: Connect Folder Source (Sync Agent)
    TenantAdmin->>Aura: Create Bundles for Guests
    TenantAdmin->>Aura: Generate QR Code for Event
```

**Tenant Admin Capabilities**:
| Action | Location | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Invite Employee | `/admin/team` (Planned) | Email with setup link |
| Assign Role | `/admin/team` (Planned) | employee/photographer |
| Remove Employee | `/admin/team` (Planned) | Revokes access, retains data |
| Connect Folder | `/admin/sources` (Planned) | Via Sync Agent |
| Revoke Folder | `/admin/sources` (Planned) | Stops sync, optionally delete cloud copy |
| View Usage | `/admin` Dashboard | Storage, uploads, searches |

### Employee Workflow

1. **Receive Credentials**: Admin sends email with login info
2. **Login**: Access `/login` with provided credentials
3. **Capture Photos**: Access `/admin/capture` for camera connection
4. **Upload Photos**: Drag-and-drop to org folder
5. **Search**: Limited to org photos only (RLS enforced)

---

## 📂 Server Folder & Storage Architecture [NEW]

> **Goal**: Define the storage structure on the cloud server for optimal organization, sync compatibility, and future scalability.

### Cloud Storage Path Convention

```
supabase-storage/
└── photos/
    └── {org_slug}/
        └── {year}/
            └── {event_or_folder_name}/
                ├── originals/
                │   └── IMG_0001.jpg
                └── optimized/
                    ├── full/        (2000px max dimension)
                    │   └── IMG_0001.webp
                    └── thumbs/      (400px max dimension)
                        └── IMG_0001.webp
```

### Path Breakdown

| Segment             | Purpose                 | Example          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| `{org_slug}`        | Tenant isolation        | `studio-abc`     |
| `{year}`            | Time-based partitioning | `2026`           |
| `{event_or_folder}` | Logical grouping        | `wedding-jan-15` |
| `originals/`        | RAW/Original uploads    | Full-res JPG/RAW |
| `optimized/full/`   | Web-optimized           | 2000px WebP      |
| `optimized/thumbs/` | Thumbnails              | 400px WebP       |

### Benefits

1. **Sync Compatibility**: Mirrors local folder structure for easy sync agent mapping
2. **Tenant Isolation**: `org_slug` as root prevents cross-tenant access
3. **Performance**: Pre-generated thumbnails for instant gallery loading
4. **Future-Proof**: Structured for CDN integration, lifecycle policies, tiered storage

| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Upload Sync**        | Local changes → Cloud (existing behavior) |
| **Download Sync**      | Cloud changes → Local (NEW)               |
| **Folder Sync Toggle** | Per-folder setting: "Always sync latest"  |
| **Selective Sync**     | Choose specific folders to sync (not all) |
| **Conflict Detection** | Hash comparison before overwrite          |

#### Sync Modes

1. **Upload-Only Mode** (Default)
   - Local folder → Cloud
   - Ideal for event photographers uploading to studio
2. **Download-Only Mode**
   - Cloud → Local folder
   - Ideal for backup to local NAS
3. **Bidirectional Mode** (Full Sync)
   - Changes in either direction synced
   - Requires conflict resolution strategy

#### Deletion Handling (CRITICAL)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[File Deleted] --> B{Deletion Source?}
    B -->|Local| C[Move to Cloud Trash]
    B -->|Cloud| D[Move to Local Trash]
    C --> E[Retain 30 days in Trash]
    D --> E
    E --> F{User Action?}m
    F -->|Restore| G[Move back to original location]
    F -->|Permanent Delete| H[Hard delete from both locations]
    F -->|30 days elapsed| H
```

**Deletion Rules**:
| Scenario | Action | Reversible |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Local delete | Cloud copy moved to `.trash/` | Yes (30 days) |
| Cloud delete | Local copy moved to `.aura_trash/` | Yes (30 days) |
| Folder delete | Mark folder as "deleted", not immediate hard delete | Yes (admin restore) |
| Conflict on restore | Rename restored file with timestamp suffix | - |

#### Conflict Resolution

| Scenario                                | Strategy                            | User Action            |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Same file modified both sides           | Last-write-wins (configurable)      | Can choose "keep both" |
| New file added both sides (same name)   | Keep both with suffix               | -                      |
| File deleted locally, modified on cloud | Cloud version wins (saved to local) | Can restore local      |
| File modified locally, deleted on cloud | Local version wins (re-uploaded)    | Can confirm delete     |

#### Sync Agent Technical Spec

```yaml
# sync_config.yaml
